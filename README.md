# Front-end code for the CCLHunter project.


Cancer cell lines have become the paradigm of cancer research, and the use of correct, contamination-free cell lines is essential for accurate and reproducible experimental results. We provide a novel improved cell line authentication method (CCLHunter) by constructs the maximum unstable unit with priori cell line topology, genotype and expression. 
CCLHunter is designed as a standlone cmd program as well as a web server version. This repository hosts the front-end code of the CCLHunter web server.

The back-end of CCLHunter is implemented by using the [FastAPI framework](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), MySQL, SAMtools. The docker images can be found at [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/zhengxc1993/cclhunter).
